<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository contains my learning journey while completing the **Scientific Computing with Python Certification** from freeCodeCamp.

Through this course, I explored foundational concepts in Python programming, including:

- Variables and data types
- String and number manipulation
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions
- Algorithms and problem solving
